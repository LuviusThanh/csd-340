        <p class="intro">
            I was born and raised in Ho Chi Minh, Vietnam. Growing up, I loved exploring the outdoors and spending time with family. 
            One of my fondest memories is hiking in the mountains and enjoying the beautiful scenery.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            My childhood was filled with adventure and learning. I had a deep passion for reading, which helped me develop 
            a love for storytelling and creativity. I also enjoyed playing sports and participating in school activities.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            In my free time, I love working on personal projects and learning new things. 
            <span class="sentence">Technology has always fascinated me, and I aspire to build a career in cyber security .</span>
            I also enjoy photography and capturing special moments.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Family is incredibly important to me. I cherish the time spent with my loved ones, whether it's cooking together, 
            traveling, or simply enjoying good conversations. These experiences have shaped who I am today.
